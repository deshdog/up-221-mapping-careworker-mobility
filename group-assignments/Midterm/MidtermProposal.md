### Proposal
Our original idea was to map numerous variables (transit, food/grocery, child care, health care, etc.) across all census tracts of the City of Los Angeles to identify pre-existing 'city care blocks.' Such blocks contain all the day-to-day essentials within a 15-20 minute walk and are especially helpful to informal care workers. This project, while interesting, requires a much longer timeline and more resources to complete successfully. We have instead decided to choose one type of care destination (LA city libraries) and work to understand how accessible it is for mobility-poor and vulnerable people.

The City of LA's 77 library branches act as community hubs that provide many services that were originally envisioned in a 'city care block.' In addition to the books, CDs, and movies that are what people first think of when a library comes to mind, Los Angeles Public Libraries (LAPL) offers much more. Libraries provide many educational services, where traditional students can [recieve tutoring and homework help](https://lapl.org/studentsuccess) or even [earn a GED](https://lapl.org/diploma). Libraries provide Internet and printing access, in addition to the [Tech2Go](https://lapl.org/tech2go) program that permits borrowing of computers and other devices. Libraries help build and connect communities, with special programming for young kids, teens, and adults. Libraries also offer social services targeted toward the [homeless](https://lapl.org/homeless-resources), [veterans](https://lapl.org/veterans), [new Americans studying for their citizenship tests](https://lapl.org/newamericans), and [the unemployed](https://lapl.org/jobs-money), to name a few. Finally, libraries can often take the shape of emergency heating and cooling shelters during extreme weather events.

In summary, libraries offer a range of services that can help improve all Angelenos' quality of life. But for those who are struggling, they can be a critical bridge to a better life. Thus, it is important for the most vulnerable Angelenos to be able to travel to their local library branch. Our project seeks to better understand where libraries are located in relation to where the most vulnerable people reside in the City of Los Angeles. Additionally, we will investigate existing transit, bicycle, and perhaps also sidewalk infrastructure to see to what extent they provide sufficient mobility from the most vulnerable census tract residents to access their local library.

### Data Update
To accomodate for our new project direction and keep us on-track, we've split our datasets into two categories:

    1. Contextual data -- data describing the social and economic context of a given one or few census tracts that surround our selected care destination for which we wish to understand more about accessibility and mobility). As of Week 5, we are using an ACS Social Vulnerability Index to operationalize social vulnerability;
    2. Geographic data -- data that described the geographic location of the care destination). 

For our Week 04 Assignment, three of us tackled datasets within the Contextual Data category: race, income, and vehicle-ownership. Meanwhile, one of us mapped LA city library locations, which lives within the Geographic Data category. Our next step is to begin overlaying our four maps to get a better picture of how race, income, vehicle ownership, and proximity to libraries (our chosen care destination) might affect care workers.

### Concerns

Now that we have narrowed the scope of our project, we have much greater confidence in our ability to create a solid output that addresses our research at the end of this quarter.
