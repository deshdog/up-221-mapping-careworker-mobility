### Proposal Introduction
Our original idea was to map numerous variables (transit, food/grocery, child care, health care, etc.) across all census tracts of the City of Los Angeles to identify pre-existing 'city care blocks.' Such blocks contain all the day-to-day essentials within a 15-20 minute walk and are especially helpful to informal care workers. This project, while interesting, requires a much longer timeline and more resources to complete successfully. We have instead decided to choose one type of care destination (LA city libraries) and work to understand how accessible it is for mobility-poor and vulnerable people.

The City of LA's 77 library branches and the County of LA's 87 library branches act as community hubs that provide many services that were originally envisioned in a 'city care block.' In addition to the books, CDs, and movies that are what people first think of when a library comes to mind, Los Angeles Public Libraries (LAPL) offers much more. Libraries provide many educational services, where traditional students can [recieve tutoring and homework help](https://lapl.org/studentsuccess) or even [earn a GED](https://lapl.org/diploma). Libraries provide Internet and printing access, in addition to the [Tech2Go](https://lapl.org/tech2go) program that permits borrowing of computers and other devices. Libraries help build and connect communities, with special programming for young kids, teens, and adults. Libraries also offer social services targeted toward the [homeless](https://lapl.org/homeless-resources), [veterans](https://lapl.org/veterans), [new Americans studying for their citizenship tests](https://lapl.org/newamericans), and [the unemployed](https://lapl.org/jobs-money), to name a few. Finally, libraries can often take the shape of emergency heating and cooling shelters during extreme weather events.

In summary, libraries offer a range of services that can help improve all Angelenos' quality of life. But for those who are struggling, they can be a critical bridge to a better life. Thus, it is important for the most vulnerable Angelenos to be able to travel to their local library branch. Our project seeks to better understand where libraries are located in relation to where the most vulnerable people reside in the City of Los Angeles. Additionally, for the final, we will investigate existing transit, bicycle, and perhaps also sidewalk infrastructure to see to what extent they provide sufficient mobility from the most vulnerable census tract residents to access their local library.

### Spatial Scope
Our spatial scope is residents of the City of Los Angeles. We are looking into County libraries due to the unique geographical shape of Los Angeles -- as residents have access to both City and County libraries, some residents of the City may live closest to a County library branch.

### Datasets
So far, we are using the following three datasets:
    1. Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) -- This dataset from the CDC operationalizes social vulnerability. It calculates social vulnerability scores for U.S. census tracts based on socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial and ethnic minority status, and housing type and transportation. 
    2. Library data -- The County of Los Angeles provides a dataset of all public libraries in the County on LA GeoHub. We filtered the dataset to only include the LA County Public Library and City of Los Angeles Public Library.
    3. Vehicle-less households data -- This data comes from the 2021 American Communities Survey (ACS), which has a question about the number of vehicles owned by each household.

### Scope
For the midterm, our focus has been visualizing social vulnerability, vehicle ownership, and library locations. We also have a map that visualizes both social vulnerability and library locations.

For the final, our focus will expand to the surrounding transportation infrastructure, and to what extent vehicle-less households can access their local library.
