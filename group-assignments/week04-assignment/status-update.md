# Status Update: Mapping Mobility for Care Workers in Los Angeles
Feb. 5, 2023 -- Proposal Link

### Roles

Maya Deshpande: Working on mapping racial demographic data this week.

Sophie Frank: 

Adam Lipsey: 

### Status Update
After reading through our feedback from the TA's on our initial project proposal, our group met outside of class to rethink the scope of our project. We originally set out to map a long list of variables (transit, food/grocery, child care, health care, etc.) across all census tracts in order to identify pre-existing 'city care blocks' in LA. Such blocks contain all the day-to-day essentials within a 15-20 minute walk and are especially helpful to inform care workers, who have been known to travel much differently within urban areas than formal laborers or non-care-takers. This project, while interesting, requires a much longer timeline and more resources to complete successfully. We have instead decided to choose one care destination (an LA city library) and work to understand how accessuble it is for care workers in the area.

### Data Update
To accomodate for our new project direction and keep us on-track, we've split our datasets into two categories:

    1. Contextual data -- data describing the social and economic context of a given one or few census tracts that surround our selected care destination for which we wish to understand more about accessibility and mobility);
    2. Geographic data -- data that described the geographic location of the care destination). 

For our Week 04 Assignment, three of us tackled datasets within the Contextual Data category: race, income, and vehicle-ownership. Meanwhile, one of us mapped LA city library locations, which lives within the Geographic Data category. Our next step is to begin overlaying our four maps to get a better picture of how race, income, vehicle ownership, and proximity to libraries (our chosen care destination) might affect care workers.
