### The Problem
Care work is the informal and often unpaid labor involved in caretaking; the burden of care work disproportionately affects women. In Los Angeles, it impacts women of color especially. The burdens of care work include but are not limited to a lack of financial, social, and physical mobility. This project focuses on analyzing the extent of physical immobility among care workers in Los Angeles by mapping existing city care blocks.

### Research Question
*How might we improve mobility for informal care workers in Los Angeles?*

### Proposed Solution
Los Angeles’ urban sprawl is a key factor in the lack of mobility for care workers. The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/City-playbook_Bogota.pdf">City of Bogotá</a> has designed a solution using urban planning wherein city planners work to provide each neighborhood with a care block: areas where both caregivers and those they care for can access city services such as professional and skills training, wellness promotion, income-generation, professional child/elder care, and recreational activities, all within a 15-20 min walking radius. We can improve mobility for informal care workers in LA by helping to develop such city blocks.

### Why This Matters
Informal care workers--folks that care for the very young, old, and disabled--have a unique and under-studied experience of city services and transportation infrastructure. Our collective understanding of mobility is dominated by the needs of formal laborers, mainly men. This patriarchal norm has resulted in the *immobility* of those for which our city systems were not initially designed for. It's important to study how immobility problems root themselves in our city's infrastructure and identify strategies that help us create a more equitable transportation landscape.

### Spatial Scope
City of Los Angeles

### Data
To better understand what mobility looks like for caretakers in LA, we can start by mapping which neighborhoods already have city blocks with care infrastructure. We’ll need LA-specific locational data for each element within the ideal care block: child/elderly/disabled care service centers, grocery stores, public spaces, schools, health care centers, designated areas for alternative economies, etc.

Most importantly, we’ll need to map the proximity of each element in relation to another and in relation to transit stations and routes, bike lanes, sidewalks, and pacifying roads.

### Scope of Visualization
Our final maps will be tied to the extent of readily-available data. Our data will include elements of the three categories outlined below: data surrounding where care workers *go*, the transportation infrastructure that allows for their mobility, and socio-economic demographics as a proxy to where care workers reside.

We will conclude with a final map of where we recommend prioritizing resources to create the first comprehensive care blocks, based on already-existing infrastructure, services, and demand.

### Expected Insights
Our goal is to assess the overlap of mobility of care destinations with supportive transportation infrastructure. We hope to better understand what the current status of mobility is for informal care workers and identify next steps to build more inclusive and accessible infrastructure going forward.
