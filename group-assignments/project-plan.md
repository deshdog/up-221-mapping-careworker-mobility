## Project Plan: Mapping Mobility for LA Careworkers

### Problem
Care work is the informal and often unpaid labor involved in caretaking; the burden of care work disproportionately affects women. In Los Angeles, it impacts women of color especially. The burdens of care work include but are not limited to a lack financial, social, and physical mobility. This project focuses on solving physical immobility for care workers in Los Angeles by mapping existing city care blocks. 

### Proposed Solution
Los Angeles’ urban sprawl is a key factor in the lack of mobility for care workers. The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/City-playbook_Bogota.pdf">City of Bogotá</a> has designed a solution using urban planning wherein city planners work to provide each neighborhood with a care block: areas where both caregivers and those they care for can access city services such as professional and skills training, wellness promotion, income-generation, professional child/elder care, and recreational activities, all within a 15-20 min walking radius.

Can someone figure out how to insert the image called bogota-care-block from 'images' folder here?

### Data
To better understand what mobility looks like for care takers in LA, we can start by mapping which neighborhoods already have city blocks with care infrastructure. We’ll need LA-specific locational data for each element within the ideal care block: child/elderly/disabled care service centers, grocery stores, public spaces, schools, health care centers, designated areas for alternative economies, etc.

Most importantly, we’ll need to map the proximity of each element in relation to another and in relation to transit stations and routes, bike lanes, sidewalks, and pacifying roads.

### Mapping Elements
```diff
Which elements do we want to map in this project?
```
* Health Care Facilities 
* Child, Elderly, and Disabled Care Facilities
* Professional Development Programs
* Alternative marketplaces
* Community Centers
* Public Spaces
* Colleges and Universities
* Bicycle Lanes
* Safe walking routes/sidewalks
* * Public transit stops + routes

### Timeline
```diff
Which datasets do we want to have cleaned and mapped by the midterm? Which datasets are high-priority, given LA's data limiations?
